Introduction:
-------------------
It is the super set of javascript.
It is compile language.
It is Strictly typed language.

How to install typeScript.
-----------------------------
npm i -g typescript 

how to execute typescript file.
---------------------------------
npx tsc fileName.ts // compile ts file and create on plain js file
node fileName.js // to execute js file

OOPS:
-------
1.class:
-------------
It is a collection of data memeber and function memeber
it is a template which we can re use.
to craete class we use class keyword.

this:
-----
it is akeyword that refers to current class variables inside an function or constructor.

2.Object:
---------------
It allows us to access class member and data member outside class.

syntax: let objName = new ClassName();

3.constructor:
-----------------
It is a special member function of class
It will execute automatically when class Object get created or initialized
we create constructor using "constructor" keyword.

Inheritance:
--------------------
Access parent class property into child class.
To perform Inheritance in b/w classes we use extends keyword.

super():
=============
It represent parent class constructor inside child class constructor.
super method must be first statement in child class constructor.

Encapsulation:
-------------
wrapping of data into single unit.

polymorphism:
----------------
It is the ability to take more than one form.

there are two types:
------------------------
1.compile time polymorphism(method overloading): 
---------------------------------------------------
when we have multiple method with same name with different parametrs.

2.Run time polymorphism(method overriding):
-----------------------------------------------
when we have multiple method with same name within different classes.

Abtsraction:
-------------------
hiding implementation and showing only necessary details.
we can achieve this by using interface,abstract class.

Module:
-------------

writing ts code in single or multiple file and access it in another file.
to achieve this we use export or import keyword.
Note: in case of default export no need of parenthesis(curly braces) in import statement.

syntax: import Student  from "./oops";(child class)
        export default Student;(parent class)

Interface:
=============

It is signature of class.
It contain abstract method.
To create interface we use interface keyword.
implementation of interface class could be done by only child class.
It can be achieved by implement keyword.
